# COMP-3705
This website was created for COMP-3705: Web Programming 2. In it, we learned to set up a full-stack web application using the MEAN stack, including backend routes for viewing and modifying the MongoDB database, as well as front-end design using AngularJS and bootstrap components. The site allows users to create, view, and update users, recipes, and recipe reviews for the cookbook. While visually basic, it demonstrates the ability to combine the use of a database as well as a front-end GUI to create a responsive and useful website concept.

This project was generated with the [Angular Full-Stack Generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) version 4.2.2.
